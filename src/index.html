        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Girls Who Surf Podcast, a series that focuses on the uncovering and elevation 
           of the voices of female surfers in Southern California. Rooted in the research conducted 
           in "Women‚Äôs Experiences in the Surfing Community of Southern California" by Benjamin Morehouse, 
           this podcast emerges as an auditory journey to compliment this work.
        </p>

        <p> 
            The "A Socioeconomic and Recreational Profile of Surfers in the United States" report by Surf-First 
            and the Surfrider Foundation, authored by G. Scott Wagner, Chad Nelsen, and Matt Walker in July 2011,
            provides an in-depth analysis of the demographics and behaviors of surfers in the United States. 
            One key finding of the report, which focuses on women surfers in Southern California, is the gender 
            composition of the surfing community. The report states:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
            "The results of the survey indicate that respondents are adults in their early 30s who are educated 
            and earn a high income. We find that surfers are male (90%), 34 years old, educated (62% have a 
            Bachelor‚Äôs degree or above), and employed full-time earning $75,000 per year."
        </blockquote>

        <p> 
            This podcast is aimed to talk to and hold up that 10% of the community, one conversation at a time. Enjoy üåä
